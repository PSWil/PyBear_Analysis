# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview

For this project I was asked to analyze the data of a ride share company named PyBer to help better understand the profitability they are achieving in different operating environments. PyBer, the company in question conducts their business in three broad categories according to population density: Urban, Suburban and Rural areas. PyBer is interested in gaining a better understanding on their profitability and volume of sales in these three categories in order to better maximize and optimize the profitability of their operations.

## Results

When it comes to the three operating environments that PyBer operates in there is a clear correlation between the size of the marker i.e.. drivers, riders and volume of fares. Urban environments have the largest portion or volume of drivers, riders and total fares being 1,625. Suburban areas come in second with slightly less than half the total number of rides than urban environments being 625 while also having much less drivers. Rural areas as expected have the lowest volume of drivers and total rides being 125.

Overall, the total fares in each operating environment are no surprise, the larger markets make substantially more than those below them with urban markets making the least number of fares overall and urban environments taking in the most. 

However, upon further analysis of the data we can see some interesting trends related to the number of drivers, fares per ride and fares per driver. These differences are quite stark when comparing the urban operating environment and the suburban and rural environments. When looking at the data shown above, we can see that the average fare per ride increases at a steady rate as we move down in environment size from urban to rural environments. A more striking relation seen in the data is the average fare per driver. In suburban areas drivers made on average $39.50 for their fares, while rural drivers made substantially more on average at $55.49 on fares. In contrast, urban drivers made the least number of fares on average at an amount of $16.57. 

While there could be some other factors that bring down the average fare per driver in the city the most obvious reason for the low average is the fact that in urban environments PyBer has more drivers registered than there are rides being placed. This over saturation of drivers in the urban market is bringing down the average fare per driver making the urban market substantially more competitive for urban drivers.

In our PyBer fare summary line graph that encompasses the 2019 months of January through April, we can see that there is a slight uptick in number of fares at the end of February and early March but over there is steady volume of fares through these months. A better way to visualize the data would be to include the entire year if your focus was on more than just spring fare volume.

## Summary

Now that we have our data organized and visualized, we can start making some recommendations to PyBer based on our analysis. We can make many recommendations that the business can look into with the data that we have currently. First and foremost, we can easily increase the efficiency of drivers and the quality control of our service in urban environments by reducing the number of drivers in that market. This reduction in drivers will make it more enticing for our knowledgeable long-term drivers to stay on with the company and benefit more financially while providing a better and more reliable service. A second recommendation that can be made can be applied to rural environments. If the business model of PyBer does not apply itself to reducing the number of drivers registered in any area, we can suggest PyBer should incentivize drivers in saturated markets to travel a bit further to underserved markets in order to increase to service to an underserved area and giving drivers who stay in the city access to a number of fares that will justify the expense of driving. Lastly, we could recommend to PyBer that the market can handle a slight price increase in the urban environment to maximize to profit where they have the highest volume. Alternatively, if PyBer is in a healthy financial position and have other goal they are trying to achieve urban environment fares could be slightly lowered to act as a loss leader or to advance PyBer's market share.

This data is just the time of the iceberg. If we had access to data regarding cancelation rates per ride ordered, ride volume by hour of day, urban surge pricing data and strategy, driver fares per hour, miles per fare driven we would be able to have a much clearer view of what the data is presenting. With that we would be more accurately be able to offer suggestions to PyBer.
