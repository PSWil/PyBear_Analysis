# PyBear_Analysis

## Overview

For this project I was asked to analyze the data of a ride share company named PyBer to help better understand the profitability they are achieving in different operating environments. PyBer, the company in question conducts their business in three broad categories according to population density: Urban, Suburban and Rural areas. PyBer is interested in gaining a better understanding on their profitability and volume of sales in these three categories in order to better maximize and optimize the profitability of their operations.

## Results

When it comes to the three operating environments that PyBer operates in there is a clear corelation betten the size of the marker ie. drivers, riders and volume of fares. Urban environments have the largest portion or volume of drivers, riders and total fares being 1,625. Suburban areas come in second with slightly less than half the total number of rides than urban environments being 625 while also having much less drivers. Rural areas as expected have the lowest volume of drivers and total rides being 125.

Urban market is oversaturated with drivers while also delivering lowest wage per trip.

Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares the have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
Although the Urban cities command the most drivers, rides and fares they have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
